# ATLiq Hardware Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive sales analysis for ATLiq Hardware, a company headquartered in New Delhi with branches in multiple locations outside India. The goal of the project is to visualize and analyze the companyâ€™s sales data, providing insights to assist in decision-making processes.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Source
The sales data was stored in a SQL database. SQL queries were used to:
- Retrieve the necessary data.
- Perform basic data manipulations such as filtering, aggregations, and data transformations to ensure the data was structured properly for analysis.

### 2. Data Integration and Cleaning
The cleaned and structured data from SQL was connected to Power BI. Using **Power Query** in Power BI, additional steps were taken to:
- Assign appropriate data types.
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Ensure data cleanliness and readiness for visualization.

### 3. Visualization Drafts
The initial draft focused on creating basic visualizations to display high-level insights, such as:
- Overall sales trends.
- Regional sales performance.
- Product category distribution.

### 4. Advanced Measures and Visualizations
To provide deeper insights, custom **DAX measures** were created to:
- Analyze metrics like profit margins, sales growth rates, and branch-wise performance.
- Allow dynamic filtering and slicing for interactive dashboards.

### 5. Feedback and Iteration
Feedback was sought from experienced data analysts based in Canada. Based on their suggestions:
- Additional dimensions were added to the analysis.
- Visualizations were refined to improve clarity and usability.
- The final draft was enhanced with better formatting, interactivity, and detailed metrics.

## Final Deliverables
The final Power BI report includes:
- An interactive dashboard showcasing key sales metrics.
- Visualizations of sales trends, regional performance, and product analysis.
- Insights derived from advanced measures and dynamic filters.

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Connect to the SQL database (if required) to refresh the data.
4. Explore the interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Acknowledgments
- A YouTube tutorial inspired the initial project workflow.
- Feedback from Canadian data analysts significantly improved the quality of the final deliverable.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating SQL and Power BI for real-world data analysis, showcasing both technical and analytical skills.
